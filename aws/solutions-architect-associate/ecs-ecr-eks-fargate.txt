Docker is great for microservices architecture, lift-and-shift applications from on-premises to AWS cloud.
Amazon ECR provides both private repositories and public repositories called ECR public gallery (https://gallery.ecr.aws/).
VMs: Infrastructure -> Host OS -> Hypervisor -> Guest OS(VM)
Container -> Infrastructure -> Host OS -> Hypervisor -> Guest OS(VM) -> Docker Daemon -> Container

# Amazon Elastic Container Service
An ECS cluster is a logical grouping of compute resources (like EC2 instances or Fargate) that acts as a foundation for running 
containerized applications. An ECS task is the smallest executable unit in a cluster, representing one or more containers running 
together based on a task definition.

EC2 launch type
The user provisions and maintains the EC2 instances. The EC2 instances are created in advance. Each EC2 instance must run ECS agent 
to register in the ECS cluster. After registering Amazon takes care of starting and stopping containers.

Fargate launch type
Serverless solution to deploy docker containers without the need to manage infrastructure. The compute resources to be allocated 
are decided on what is provided in the ECS task. To scale, increasing the number of tasks is the standard method. Defining multiple
containers within the same task isnt scaling, as resources are defined at the task level and all containers inside that one task must 
share that single pool of resources. If 2 containers are defined, it doesnt mean fargate allocates 2x resources of what is defined in the task.
